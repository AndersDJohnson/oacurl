OACurl -- OAuth-enabled HTTP tool

Provided as sample code for using OAuth in Java and for poking at
OAuth-enabled APIs, especially Google's.

For information, see: http://code.google.com/p/oacurl/


BUILDING

$ mvn assembly:assembly


SAMPLE USAGE

# Open a web browser to do the OAuth dance and save the credentials
# locally. The --buzz sets the right scope and service provider URLs.
$ java -cp target/oacurl-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar com.google.oacurl.Login --buzz

# GET a URL using the saved credentials from step 1.
$ java -cp target/oacurl-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar com.google.oacurl.Fetch \
    https://www.googleapis.com/buzz/v1/activities/@me/@consumption


We recommend that you create "oacurl-login" and "oacurl" aliases or
shell scripts to avoid dealing with the classpath and main class every
time.
